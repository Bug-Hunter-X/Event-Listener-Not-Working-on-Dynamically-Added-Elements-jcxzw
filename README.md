This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where an event listener fails to work on dynamically added elements. The issue arises when an event listener is attached to an element that's added to the DOM after the script containing the listener has already executed. The bug.html file showcases the problem, while bugSolution.html provides a corrected version using event delegation.
